## Creates a special matrix object able to store its own inverse,
## to potentially save time :)

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Returns the inverse to the special matrix object defined in
## makeCacheMatrix (returns the cahced inverse if available)

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
